On that note, does being \"overweight\" actuallylead to an unsafer pregnancy? And what can someone do to ensurea healthy pregnancy if they can\\'t lose weight?Any more thoughts on weight gain/being overweight and how itrelates to pregnant people and their health are welcome. Fulldisclosure: This is in defense of body positivity/neutrality,and I don\\'t plan to preach weight loss as a cure-all for healthypregnancies. (I also doubt it\\'s that simple!)Thank you!\\n',\n",
